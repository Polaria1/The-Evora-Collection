# The-Evora-Collection
This is a workspace for my mod for Endless Sky, the Evora Collection.
This collection plans to add four alien species and at least a small questline for each of them:

- The Evora

A species of bipedal lizards whom specialize in extremely advanced engine technology and have a love for fixed weapons! Expect lots of guns!

- The Doyek

Quadruped drakes that believe in quality over quantity. Anything below a medium warship is a sin. 

- The Chiuzu

Giant, space-faring rodents. No, not the Hai (although they were kind of inspired by them!)

- Chikidikiis

The Wabbajack of Endless Sky aliens. Ever wanted to weaponize a planet?

# MOD IS CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL; THIS IS MY FIRST EVER MOD, SO IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME
(seriously, don't download this, it's just a readme.md right now)
